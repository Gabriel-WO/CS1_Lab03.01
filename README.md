This project is a Maze Runner game. There are three different levels that get increasingly harder in navigability, but each run changes depending on what types of enemies spawn or where collectibles spawn. Your goal is to collect all the coins in each room without dying; interior walls and enemies cause damage upon collision, with certain enemy types dealing more damage. If your score qualifies, you'll appear on a high scores list with your initials.
